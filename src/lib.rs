//! `rusty_a2a` - a Rust implementation of the [Agent2Agent (A2A)
//! protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/), an open standard for
//! interoperable communication between AI agents.
//!
//! This crate provides:
//!
//! - [`types`]: the complete A2A protocol data model (`Task`, `Message`,
//!   `AgentCard`, ...), transliterated from the normative
//!   `specification/a2a.proto`.
//! - [`client`] (feature `client`): an async client for calling A2A agents
//!   over the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol binding, including SSE streaming.
//! - [`server`] (feature `server`): an [`axum`]-based server harness for
//!   implementing an A2A agent: implement [`server::AgentExecutor`] and get
//!   agent-card discovery, task lifecycle management, and streaming for
//!   free, over the JSON-RPC and HTTP+JSON/REST protocol bindings at once.
//!   Add the `grpc` feature and use [`server::AgentServices`] to serve the
//!   same agent state over gRPC too.
//! - [`signing`] (feature `signing`): Agent Card JWS signing and
//!   verification (spec Section 8.4).
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! The A2A specification defines three interoperable protocol bindings:
//! JSON-RPC 2.0, gRPC, and HTTP+JSON/REST (spec Sections 9-11). This
//! crate's server implements all three - JSON-RPC and HTTP+JSON/REST from
//! the same `axum` router/port (`server::AgentServer::into_router`), and
//! gRPC via `server::AgentServices::grpc_service`/`serve_grpc` (feature
//! `grpc`, compiled from the vendored `spec/a2a.proto` by `build.rs`;
//! requires a `protoc` binary on `PATH`). All bindings share one task
//! store and executor. The client only speaks JSON-RPC so far. Per spec
//! Section 5.1, an agent only needs to support the protocols it declares
//! in its `AgentCard`, so any subset is spec-compliant.
